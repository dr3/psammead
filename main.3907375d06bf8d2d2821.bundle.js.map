It supports having an image on the left of the promo with info on the right. This info can be any collection of nodes, however typically these would be a headline, text summary and timestamp.\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\n`npm install @bbc/psammead-story-promo`\\n\\n## StoryPromo Props\\n\\n| Argument | Type   | Required | Default | Example        |\\n| -------- | ------ | -------- | ------- | -------------- |\\n| image    | node   | No       | Null    | `<img>`          |\\n| info     | node   | Yes      | N/A     | `<h2>Title</h2>` |\\n| mediaIndicator     | node   | No      | null     | `<MediaIndicator duration=\\\"2:15\\\" datetime=\\\"PT2M15S\\\" offscreenText=\\\"Video 2 minutes 15 seconds\\\" />` |\\n| topStory | boolean | No      | false   | true          |\\n\\n## Headline Props\\n\\n| Argument  | Type | Required | Default | Example |\\n| --------- | ---- | -------- | ------- | ------- |\\n| Script    | object | yes | latin | { canon: { groupA: { fontSize: '28', lineHeight: '32',}, groupB: { fontSize: '32', lineHeight: '36', }, groupD: { fontSize: '44', lineHeight: '48', }, }, trafalgar: { groupA: { fontSize: '20', lineHeight: '24', }, groupB: { fontSize: '24', lineHeight: '28', }, groupD: { fontSize: '32', lineHeight: '36', }, }, }|\\n\\n## Summary Props\\n\\n| Argument  | Type | Required | Default | Example |\\n| --------- | ---- | -------- | ------- | ------- |\\n| Script    | object | yes | latin | { canon: { groupA: { fontSize: '28', lineHeight: '32',}, groupB: { fontSize: '32', lineHeight: '36', }, groupD: { fontSize: '44', lineHeight: '48', }, }, trafalgar: { groupA: { fontSize: '20', lineHeight: '24', }, groupB: { fontSize: '24', lineHeight: '28', }, groupD: { fontSize: '32', lineHeight: '36', }, }, }|\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nThe typical use-case of this component is as displayed below. A Image sits on the left side of the promo with info elements on the right. These info elements are typically a headline, text summary paragraph and timestamp. The `Headline` and `Summary` components are provided by this package and can be imported as seen below.\\n\\nThis component also has an option to display a media indicator, which consists of a play icon and duration of the media, if that data is provided. \\n\\nThe `topStory` prop can be passed to adopt a vertical card layout under 600px. This is designed to be used only on the first (top) story on an index. This prop must be passed to the StoryPromo, Headline and Summary components.\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport React, { Fragment } from 'react';\\nimport StoryPromo, { Headline, Summary, Link } from '@bbc/psammead-story-promo';\\nimport { latin } from '@bbc/gel-foundations/scripts';\\n\\nconst Image = (\\n  <img src=\\\"https://foobar.com/image.jpg\\\" />\\n);\\n\\nconst Info = (\\n  <Fragment>\\n    <Headline script={latin} topStory={true}>      \\n      <Link href=\\\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news\\\">The headline of the promo</Link>\\n    </Headline>\\n    <Summary script={latin} topStory={true}>\\n      The summary of the promo\\n    </Summary>\\n    <time>12 March 2019</time>\\n  </Fragment>\\n);\\n\\n<StoryPromo\\n  image={Image}\\n  info={Info}\\n  topStory={true}\\n/>\\n```\\n\\n### When to use this component\\n\\nThe `StoryPromo` component is designed to be used within a link element to allow the user to navigate to the story on another page.\\n\\n<!-- ### When not to use this component -->\\n\\n### Accessibility notes\\n\\nThis component uses full semantic markup for the `Headline`, `Summary`, and `Link`, using `h3`, `p` and `a` respectively. Other accessibility factors such as image alt text and time elements are passed in as props and aren't explicitly set in this component. \\n\\nThe link is nested inside the `h3` for better support with VoiceOver Mac and Safari. We use the `faux block link` pattern which makes the entire block clickable, whilst also enabling links nested within in that block to also be clickable.\\n\\nWe haven't yet thoroughly looked at cross device browser AT testing yet, this is in-progress. We will update with a11y notes when carrying out a proper release.\\n\\n## Roadmap\\n\\nThis component will soon be integrated on to add support for additional UX and product requirements such as;\\n\\n- Hover and focus states\\n- Logic to toggle a 'Top Story' mode which has greater text size and a vertically stacked design\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nPsammead is completely open source.
